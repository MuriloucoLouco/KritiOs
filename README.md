# KritiOs
The project’s Goal to learn and implement concepts of Operating systems and create a toy UNIX type 32 bit OS from scratch which includes
The bootloader, drivers and some basic functionality.

## Tools Used

The Project utilizes NASM Assembly Compiler for assembly compilations and GCC Cross Compiler (elf-i386) to compile C code for 32 Bit machines. 
For virtualization and testing,  qemu was used. 
Linux’s make command was also utilized for hassle free compilations.  

The project was also tested on a spare laptop without any OS installed, which worked fine.
